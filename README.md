## Overview
This coding challenge tested my know-how of centering a content and making decision when it's best to use the CSS grid or flexbox.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

I started by uploading the design images to figma and from there i used the rectangle feature. I drew a rectangle over the design and made the background almost invisible since my aim was to use it to get the dimensions of the design image. 
I set up the build process using npm which automatically generates a package.json where i save the different packages as dependencies to help watch for changes, automatically add prefixes for properties that needs it and compile the sass to plain css. I love using sass for my css as it gives me more flexibility, reusability and ultimately architecture. 
I wrote the HTML5 using the BEM convention for naming the classes of the various HTML tags and styled them using CSS grid for the main content because it involves 2-D layout and used flexbox for the 1-D vertical layout of the general component and flex in flex horizontal layout.
It was a fun challenge as it helped me practice the use of CSS layouts. 


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to create the overlay hover effect on an image using positioning properties

### Continued development

I would love to continue working with CSS grid and flexbox because there is an almost endless possibility using both tools

### Useful resources

- [hover effects on image](https://codepen.io/nxworld/pen/ZYNOBZ?editors=1100) - This helped me for creating the overlay hover effect on my image. There are also other CSS hover effects from that codepen
- [CSS reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS reset. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
